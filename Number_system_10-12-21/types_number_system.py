'''Number system:

The number system or the numeral system is the system of naming or representing numbers.
A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers.
The value of any digit in a number can be determined by:

The digit
Its position in the number
The base of the number system


A number is a mathematical value used for counting or measuring or labelling objects.
Numbers are used to performing arithmetic calculations.  Examples of numbers are natural numbers, whole numbers,
rational and irrational numbers, etc. 0 is also a number that represents a null value.

types of numbers:

Natural numbers:
containing all counting numbers starting from 1.
example: N={1,2,3,4,.....}

whole numbers:
It is collection of 0 and natual numbers.
eg: W={0,1,2,3,4,....}

Integers:
Collection result of whole numbers and negative of all natural numbers.
eg:-infinity,......-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,.........infinity


Relational numbers:
Numbers that can be written in the form of p/q, where q≠0.
eg:- 5/6,8/3

Irrational numbers:
All the numbers which are not rational and cannot be written in the form of p/q.
eg: Irrational numbers are non-terminating and non-repeating in nature like √2.

Even numbers:
even numbers are those numbers that are exactly divided by 2.
eg:2,4,6,8,10,...

odd numbers:
A number that is not divisible by 2 and leaves a remainder '1'.
eg:1,3,5,7....

Prime numbers:
Prime numbers are the positive integers having only two factors, 1 and the integer itself.

eg:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103,\

composite numbers:
composite numbers are numbers that have more than two factors. These numbers are also called composites.
eg:4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44,\

complex numbers:
are the numbers that are expressed in the form of a+ib where, a,b are real numbers and  ‘i’ is
an imaginary number called “iota”. The value of i = (√-1).
For example, 2+3i is a complex number, where 2 is a real number (Re) and 3i is an imaginary number (Im).

Real numbers:
combination of rational numbers and irrational numbers.


Data Types:

Text Type:	str eg:'srilekha'

Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset(eg:x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"}))
Boolean Type:	bool (True,False)
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview



Conversion: converting from one unit to another unit ....one data type to another datatype

Temperature:

1 celsius =33.8 Fahrenheit

Length:

Length:
            1 km = 1000 m
            1 m  = 100 cm
            1 cm = 10 mm    ==> 1KM + 100M ==>  1KM + 0.1KM = 1.1 KM**
                                               1000M + 100M = 1100 M
