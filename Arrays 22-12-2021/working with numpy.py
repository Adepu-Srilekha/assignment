#numpy is used to create single and multi dimensional arrays
#numpy contains library of mathematical functions like linear algebra and fourier transform
#if n=1 -- one dimensional array,n=2-- two dimensional array, n=3------ three dimensional array
#creating single dimensional array
import numpy
x=numpy.array([1,2,4,56,7])
print(x)
